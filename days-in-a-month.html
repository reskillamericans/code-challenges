    <h1>How Many Days in the Month?</h1>
    <p>
        A common problem in working with dates, is to calculate the days of the month for any given
        month and year. Due to leap years, the rules can get a little tricky. Here are the rules in
        English:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Jan, Mar, May, Jul, Aug, Oct, Dec have 31 days.</li>
        <li>Apr, Jun, Sep, Nov have 30 days.</li>
        <li>Feb has 28 days EXCEPT when it is a leap year, and then it has 29.</li>
        <li>Leap Year Rules
            <ul>
                <li>If the year is divisible by 4, it's a leap year.</li>
                <li>EXCEPT, if it's divisible by 100, then it's NOT a leap year.</li>
                <li>EXCEPT, if it's divisible by 400, then it really is a leap year (again).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        So, leap years include 2000 and 2004, but NOT 1900 or 2100.
    </p>
    <p> Here is a perfectly reasonable piece of code to calculate the days of the month for a given
        month and year:
    </p>
    <div class="code-block">
        <code id="sample" class="code"></code>
    </div>
    <p>
        But, what if, just for fun, we'd like to write this function using the fewest possible characters (instead of
        going for readability or maintainability)? Try filling in the expression below to evaluate to the number
        of days in a month, <span class="code">m</span>, for a given year, <span class="code">y</span> (a first
        attempt has been started for you).
    </p>
    <div id="user-code">
        <label for="ucode">(m, y) =></label>
        <textarea autofocus id="ucode" class="code"
            placeholder="Enter a JavaScript expression">m == 2 ? 28 : 31</textarea>
    </div>
    <div id="error"></div>
    <div class="analysis">
        <div><span id="chars">9</span> characters</div>
        <div>Accuracy: <span id="accuracy">0.00%</span></div>
        <div>Efficiency: <span id="efficiency">0.00%</span> / char</div>
    </div>

    <div id="canonical-years">
    </div>

    <div id="boast">
        I wrote a JavaScript expression for the number of days in a month
        with <span id="accuracy2">0.00%</span> accuracy in only
        <span id="chars2">0</span> characters.  How well can you do?<br>
