    <h1>Reskill Americans<br>Code Challenge -- <br>Maze Generator</h1>

    <div>
        In this code challenge, you will write a Maze Generator. The problem is
        to determine how to remove walls in a <i>grid</i> to form a proper maze.

        A proper maze should have:

        <ol>
            <li><b>Reachability: </b>Allow a wanderer to start at any cell in the grid, and
                reach any other cell in the grid - without walking through
                any walls.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>No Loops: </b>There should be exactly <b>one</b> path between any two
                cells in the grid (not counting back-tracking). <i>Note that a grid with this
                    property will have N - 1 walls removed if it has N cells.</i>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div>
        You can watch a sample solution, by pressing the Run button, below. When
        you are ready to try writing your own solution, open this

        Note the API reference at the bottom of this page.
    </div>

    <div id="challenge"></div>

    <h1>API Reference</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            Your solution should be defined in the form of a <i>JavaScript</i>
            <i>generator function</i>. You're not required to be familiar with
            that. Only to know that your function name should have an "*"
            in front of it, and that you should use the <i>yield</i> statement
            in the inner loop of your solution. This will allow the grid
            visualization to display the workings of your program and for you
            to control the execution speed with the buttons beneath the grid.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>grid.cell</b>(<i>row, col</i>) - Call this function to retrieve an
                individual <i>Cell</i> in the <i>Grid</i>. The elements of the <i>Grid</i>
                start at (0, 0) for the upper left cell, and increase to the right
                and down.  The lower right cell of a 10 by 10 <i>Grid</i> is at at (9, 9).
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>cell.mark</b> - This boolean property can be used to keep track of
                cells you have visited. When set to <i>true</i> they will appear
                highlighted in the grid.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>cell.testWall</b>(<i>dir</i>) - Test to see if there is a wall currently
                present next to the cell.  The direction argument is a number from 0 to 3.
                <ul>
                    <li>0 - up</li>
                    <li>1 - right</li>
                    <li>2 - down</li>
                    <li>3 - left</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>cell.removeWall</b>(<i>dir</i>) - Remove the wall of the cell in the direction
                given.  Note that there is only one wall between any two cells (you don't have to
                remove the up wall of wall cell, as well as the down wall of the cell above it).
            </li>
            <ul>
    </div>

    <h1>Hints</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            The sample generator shown in this demo works by starting with the center cell
            of the maze.  It "marks" it as being included in the set of cells reachable from
            the center cell.
        </p>
        <p>
            It then picks a random cell and a direction.  If the cell, and it's neighbor
            in that direction are on opposite sides of a wall with one cell being "marked"
            and the other cell being "unmarked", then it can remove the wall and increase
            the number of reachable cells from the center.  It then marks the previously
            unmarked cell, and choosing another random cell in the grid.
        </p>
        <p>
            The algorithm returns when N - 1 walls have been removed (for a grid with
            N cells in it), since, by that criteria, all cells will be reachable from
            the center (as well as every other cell).
        </p>
